UDP pinger
This program is written in Java , Named UDPPinger under the source UDPPinger.java
In the source, there constant call host is the server address. By default, I set it to localhost
if server response the ping, the program will print the delay. If the server not response in one second, the program will print lost.

I use java to create this chat room program
To complie program, go to the source folder and type
Javac *.java
For both server and client program
In server side, I create 3 class called ChatServer, Client and Room.
The ChatServer class take cake about the accepting new clients and the main function of the chat room
The Client take cake information about each client and has its own thread to read the message from the client program. The Socket is managed in this class
The Room class take cake all the room related function. 
When a client login into the server, it will be not in any room. Client has to use command in order to get into a room.
All of the basic command is functioning

In the client side, is a simple basic program that print message come from the server and sent message that user typed with a time. 
Went the program started. It asks the address of the Server.

For both server and client, there is a hard coded constant that show the port that the server is listening to.
